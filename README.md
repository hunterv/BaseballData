## Using the Scripts:  
I included some scripts that I find useful. The project can be built by running "./build.sh" in the src directory. The latest build can be run by running "./run.sh" in the project directory. 

## What's Done:  
* I just pasted my code from A2 in there.  
* I feel like it has a lot of basic things we can use as a jumping off point. All of the data is cleaned as well and should be usable.  
* I created an output directory, let's store any useful final output there so we don't lose it if we have to reformat HDFS
